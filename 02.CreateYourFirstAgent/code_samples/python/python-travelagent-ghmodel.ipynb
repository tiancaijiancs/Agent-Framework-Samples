    "# 🚀 Create Your First AI Agent - Travel Planning Assistant (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Tutorial Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your first hands-on experience building an AI agent with the Microsoft Agent Framework! This tutorial will guide you through creating a sophisticated travel planning assistant that can automatically generate personalized vacation itineraries using GitHub Models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You'll Build:**\n",
    "- 🎯 **Smart Travel Agent**: An AI assistant that plans detailed day trips\n",
    "- 🎲 **Random Destination Tool**: Custom function for inspiring destination suggestions\n",
    "- 🤖 **Conversational Interface**: Natural language interaction with advanced AI capabilities\n",
    "- 🔧 **Tool Integration**: Learn how agents use functions to extend their capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this tutorial, you will understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ **Agent Architecture Fundamentals**\n",
    "- How to structure AI agents using the Microsoft Agent Framework\n",
    "- The relationship between agents, tools, and language models\n",
    "- Best practices for agent configuration and deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ **Tool Integration Patterns**\n",
    "- Creating custom functions that agents can call dynamically\n",
    "- Understanding function calling in large language models\n",
    "- Designing tools for optimal agent performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔗 **API Integration Strategies**\n",
    "- Connecting to GitHub Models for enterprise-grade AI inference\n",
    "- Managing API credentials and configuration securely\n",
    "- Handling asynchronous operations in agent workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 **Conversation Management**\n",
    "- Building natural, contextual conversations with AI agents\n",
    "- Managing conversation state and memory\n",
    "- Implementing effective agent instructions and personality\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Prerequisites & Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦 **Required Dependencies**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, ensure you have the latest Agent Framework installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install agent-framework-core -U\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔑 **GitHub Models Configuration**\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll need access to GitHub Models (currently in preview):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sign up for GitHub Models**: Visit [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) and request access\n",
    "2. **Generate Personal Access Token**: Create a token with model access permissions\n",
    "3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in your project root:\n",
    "\n",
    "```env\n",
    "# GitHub Models API Configuration\n",
    "GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token_here\n",
    "GITHUB_ENDPOINT=https://models.inference.ai.azure.com\n",
    "GITHUB_MODEL_ID=gpt-4o-mini\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏢 **Enterprise Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Security**: Store API keys in environment variables, never in source code\n",
    "- **Rate Limits**: GitHub Models has usage quotas; monitor your consumption\n",
    "- **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate models based on your use case and budget\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for production deployments\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎨 Design Pattern: Function-Calling Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates the **Function-Calling Agent** pattern, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph LR\n",
    "    A[User Request] --> B[Agent Analysis]\n",
    "    B --> C{Need Tools?}\n",
    "    C -->|Yes| D[Call Function]\n",
    "    C -->|No| E[Direct Response]\n",
    "    D --> F[Process Results]\n",
    "    F --> E\n",
    "    E --> G[Final Response]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Benefits:**\n",
    "- 🎯 **Deterministic Actions**: Tools provide reliable, predictable functionality\n",
    "- 🔧 **Extensibility**: Easy to add new capabilities without retraining\n",
    "- 🏢 **Enterprise Ready**: Integrate with existing systems and databases\n",
    "- 📊 **Observability**: Clear tracking of agent decisions and tool usage\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌟 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "After completing this tutorial, explore:\n",
    "- **Advanced Tool Patterns**: Database queries, API integrations, file operations\n",
    "- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordinating multiple specialized agents\n",
    "- **RAG Integration**: Adding knowledge retrieval capabilities\n",
    "- **Production Deployment**: Scaling agents for enterprise use\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build your first AI agent! 🚀"
