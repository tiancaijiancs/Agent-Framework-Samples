    "# 🔍 Exploring Agentic Frameworks - Basic Agent (Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the fundamental concepts of the Microsoft Agent Framework through a basic agent implementation. You'll learn core agentic patterns and understand how intelligent agents work under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What You'll Discover:**\n",
    "- 🏗️ **Agent Architecture**: Understanding the basic structure of AI agents\n",
    "- 🛠️ **Tool Integration**: How agents use external functions to extend capabilities  \n",
    "- 💬 **Conversation Flow**: Managing multi-turn conversations and context\n",
    "- 🔧 **Configuration Patterns**: Best practices for agent setup and management\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Key Concepts Covered\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agentic Framework Principles\n",
    "- **Autonomy**: How agents make independent decisions\n",
    "- **Reactivity**: Responding to environmental changes and user inputs\n",
    "- **Proactivity**: Taking initiative based on goals and context\n",
    "- **Social Ability**: Interacting through natural language\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Components\n",
    "- **ChatAgent**: Core agent orchestration and conversation management\n",

    "## 📚 Framework Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates the Microsoft Agent Framework approach compared to other agentic frameworks:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Microsoft Agent Framework | Other Frameworks |\n",
    "|---------|-------------------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Integration** | Native Microsoft ecosystem | Varied compatibility |\n",
    "| **Simplicity** | Clean, intuitive API | Often complex setup |\n",
    "| **Extensibility** | Easy tool integration | Framework-dependent |\n",
    "| **Enterprise Ready** | Built for production | Varies by framework |\n",
