# Introduction to AI Agents

This tutorial provides an overview of AI agents, their ecosystem within Microsoft technologies, and the frameworks that support their development.

## What's an AI Agent?

An AI agent is an autonomous entity capable of perceiving its environment, reasoning, and taking actions to achieve specific goals. These agents can operate independently or collaboratively within systems to perform tasks such as automation, decision-making, and data analysis. 

For a comprehensive introduction, you can explore the [Microsoft's beginner-friendly guide to AI agents](https://github.com/microsoft/ai-agents-for-beginners/tree/main/01-intro-to-ai-agents). This resource covers fundamental concepts, different types of AI agents, and their applications in real-world scenarios. 

(*Note: No sample code was included, focusing instead on core concepts and principles.*)

## Introduce Azure AI Foundry Agent Service

Microsoft offers the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service—an integrated platform designed to build, deploy, and manage intelligent agents at scale. This service simplifies the development of AI-powered agents by providing tools and infrastructure that enable organizations to create agents capable of understanding, reasoning, and interacting with users or systems.

You can read more about the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service's capabilities, use cases, and how it integrates within the Azure cloud ecosystem in the [official overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-foundry/agents/overview). It highlights how organizations can leverage this service to accelerate intelligent agent deployment without needing to develop everything from scratch.

(*Note: No sample code was provided; the focus is on understanding the service's purpose and benefits.*)

## Microsoft Agent Framework

To support the development of AI agents, Microsoft offers the [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework/tree/main/docs/docs-templates). This framework provides a set of tools, templates, and best practices for designing, building, and managing AI agents effectively.

The framework includes various templates and structured approaches that help developers create robust agents aligned with Microsoft's platform standards. It enables consistent development workflows, promotes reuse, and simplifies integration with other Azure services.

This framework is ideal for developers seeking a structured methodology to develop scalable, maintainable AI agents.
