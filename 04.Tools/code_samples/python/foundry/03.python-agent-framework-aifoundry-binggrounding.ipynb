      "Agent: The GitHub Copilot Agent Workshop at the link https://github.com/kinfey/GHCAgentWorkshop is designed to help participants learn how to build applications using GitHub Copilot's Agent mode without any coding. The workshop is organized into several hands-on experiments:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Experiment 1 - RAG Application:** Introduces GitHub Copilot's model capabilities, how to use Agent mode in the Copilot Edit environment, creating Copilot application frontends, and calling GitHub models via Copilot Agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Experiment 2 - Stock Analysis:** Guides through generating simulated data with the Copilot Agent, building the stock user interface, and constructing both front and backend.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Experiment 3 - GPT-5 Experience and Application Deployment:** Demonstrates using the GPT-5 model with GitHub Copilot, creating a lottery wheel application via Agent Mode, and deploying the app through GitHub Pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "The workshop aims to give users a zero-code experience to create Copilot applications leveraging AI enhancements, making everyone feel like a project manager aided by AI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Preparation requires a GitHub account, forking and cloning the project repository, with tools including Python 3.10.8+ (recommended via Miniforge), Visual Studio Code Insider edition, and the Python extension for VS Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional resources include links for free GitHub Copilot access and detailed blogs about GitHub Copilot’s Agent mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this workshop gives an interactive and practical introduction to using GitHub Copilot's next-generation Agent mode to create AI-driven applications efficiently and effectively without programming knowledge【3:0†source】.\n"
