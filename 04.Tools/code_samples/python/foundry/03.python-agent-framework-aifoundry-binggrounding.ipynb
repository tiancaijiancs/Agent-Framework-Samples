      "Agent: The GHCAgentWorkshop on GitHub is a workshop designed to help participants create GitHub Copilot applications with zero coding, leveraging the AI-powered GitHub Copilot Agent. The workshop introduces users to the agent mode of GitHub Copilot Chat that allows direct project creation from requirements. It is structured in a hands-on way, consisting of multiple experiments to explore the capabilities of GitHub Copilot agents, from model functions to application building and deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The workshop includes:\n",
      "- Preparations such as having a GitHub account, forking and cloning the repository, and setting up Python and Visual Studio Code with relevant plugins.\n",
      "- Experiment 1 (RAG Application): Understanding GitHub Copilot model capabilities, working with the agent mode, creating a front-end Copilot application, and calling GitHub models through the agent.\n",
      "- Experiment 2 (Stock Analysis): Generating simulated data with the Copilot agent, building a stock UI, and developing both front-end and back-end components.\n",
      "- Experiment 3 (Experience GPT-5 and App Deployment): Using the GPT-5 model within GitHub Copilot, creating a lottery wheel application with the agent mode, and deploying the application via GitHub Pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "The workshop focuses on making everyone feel like a project manager empowered by AI, with a low-code/no-code approach to create AI-assisted projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, it provides resources for free GitHub Copilot use and links to further readings about GitHub models and Copilot agent capabilities. The repository contains code, markdown files, and other resources to facilitate learning these concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, GHCAgentWorkshop is an instructional repository that teaches users how to leverage GitHub Copilot’s agent mode to efficiently build and deploy AI applications through interactive experiments and practical coding scenarios in a no-code or low-code manner. It is suitable for developers eager to explore GitHub Copilot's advanced features in building automation and coding assistants【3:0†source】.\n"
